<h4>Favorite CMSC Subject: CMSC22 </h4>
 	<p> It was fun taking all my CMSC Subjects but CMSC22 was outstanding because Java was really fun to learn and to code. It was also very fulfilling to complete the subject's exercises and project.</p>

<h4>Favorite Food: Ice Cream </h4>
	<p>Ice creams are cool! They are very delicious, especially the ones I make on my own or with my brother.</p>

<h4>About Me:</h4>
	<p> I am a very simple, God fearing, caring, understanding, trustworthy and kind hearted human being. I am a happy go lucky guy who believes in the motto "Never Give Up". I am fun loving, down to earth and very much Optimist. I love playing video games, travelling, watching movies, tv series, animes, kdramas or any kinds of videos, and listening to music.</p>

<h4> CMSC 100 </h4>
	<p>	I expect to learn more about web programming and become a lot better since web development is one of the subjects in computer science that I'm having trouble at. I also expect that the course will be taught to us in a fun and interactive way.</p>
